        <h2>Are you feeling lazy? If you've got the cabbage I've got the butter...</h2>
        <p>It's one of those days. No think pls, food appear pls. This is that recipe.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cabbage</li>
            <li>Salt and Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put on Youtube or Netflix or whatever you use.</li>
            <li>Take cabbage split in in half and rinse. Then split those halves in half and remove the core.</li>
            <li>Choppa, choppa, choppa the cabbage as much as you need and save the unchoppa'd for later.</li>
            <li>Put pan on stove. Heat under pan - max. Butter in pan.</li>
            <li>Sigh... (Do it. This is an important step) </li>
            <li>Telepath the choppa'd cabbage in pan and add salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>It will cook itself trust me, but stir occasionally for good heat distribution.</li>
            <li>Like 10 min of watching Youtube? I never pay attention, its you're done.</li>

        </ol>
