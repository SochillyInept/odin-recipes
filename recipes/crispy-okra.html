        <h1>Crispy Okra</h1>

        <h2>You'dve never known it could be so good</h2>
        <p>Okra often gets a bad wrap for being slimy, green, and hard even when cooked, definitely not the most inviting characteristics to support your meal. Luckily though, like many things in life, with a bit of effort you can turn this F tier raw veggie into a <strong>S tier</strong>, <strong>meal defining</strong> dish. God has brought you here, to this webpage, for this specific revelation.</p> 

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Okra</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
