        <h2>You'dve never known it could be so good</h2>
        <p>Okra often gets a bad wrap for being slimy, green, and hard even when cooked, definitely not the most inviting characteristics to support your meal. Luckily though, like many things in life, with a bit of effort you can turn this F tier raw veggie into a <strong>S tier</strong>, <strong>meal defining</strong> dish. God has brought you here, to this webpage, for this specific revelation.</p> 

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Okra</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>On to the cooking!</h3>
        <p>I've never found measurements useful when it comes to cooking. I either don't have enough of the ingredient, don't have the exact right ingredient, or I don't have the appropriate tool (or patience) to measure whatever ingredient. So for this recipe, we're gonna go by just <em>'feels'</em>. It's simple, trust yourself. OK! Assuming you've found the ingredients, and found a kitchen, let's start! </p>
       
        
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Slice your okra. <p>Well, first you wash it and dry it in some paper towels... but after that! You can line them up equal height to each other, Cut off the head, then the tail, and you can throw those bits away. Now the slicing begins and you can reduce the remaining body in checkers piece width slices.</p> </li>
            
            <li>Chop the Onions. <p>Well, first you peel it... but after that! Cut it full length horizontal then vertical (or vice versa), and you're done. To be honest you can do whatever you want with the onions. I it this way.</p></li>
            
            <li>Have your Olive oil, salt, and cayenne pepper ready.</li>

            <li>Congrats, you're done with the preparation!</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pan - get it, non-stick, frying, a flat rock, whatever. Find it and put it on the stove.</li>

            <li>Olive oil, you'll need more than a drip. Pour <em>just</em> enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Now turn the stove to high heat, and don't worry if it feels like the oil is shrinking, you can always put a little more. Remember were going off <em>feels</em>. </li>

            <li>Once the oil starts popping, take your sliced Okra and put it in. We're just gonna leave it like this for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to distribute the heat. We are watching for the Okra to brown</li>

            <li>Are you 1 minute in, 5 minutes or 10? Doesn't matter, we can put in the <strong>salt</strong>, <strong>cayenne pepper</strong> in now. You can start tasting when it starts to brown around the 5 min mark, to gauge if you need more salt or pepper</li>

            <li>10 minutes or more in great. Throw in the <strong>chopped onions</strong> it should be browning nicely at this point.</li>

            <li>All thats left to do now is to taste the onions. <strong>NOTE</strong>: This step requires you to know what cooked onions taste like. Once you believe they're cooked enough you are done</li>
            <li>You're done! (just in case you skipped the previous sentence) </li>
        
        </ol>
